# Introduction

The main chapters from the book "Software Architecture Fundamentals: A Study Guide for the Certified Professional for
Software Architecture â€“ Foundation Level" are covered and summarized. At the end of each chapter, the book provides a
number of learning goals and questions which have been answered. The answers can be found at the end of each.
Additionally, a separate [**Questions & Answers**](questions-and-answers.md) sections has been added where the answers are
hidden initially. This
is practical for self-study and self-assessment.

If something is missing or you have an improvement, then
