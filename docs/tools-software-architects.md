# Tools for Software Architects

## Learning Goals

- **Name and explain important tool categories**
    - **Requirements management tools**: Helps with collecting, organizing, presenting requirements and often serves as
      a basis for a contractual agreement
    - **Modelling tools**: Graphical representation of the dependencies and interactions of system components. Depending
      on the degree of technical detail, graphs can sometimes be hard to understand for non-technical readers.
    - **Generation tools**: Generate code artifacts based on an abstract metamodel or file
    - **Static code analysis tools**: Analyze source code and checks if the code follows predefined rules to ensure
      maintainability, simplicity, efficiency etc.
    - **Dynamic code analysis tools**: Analyze the runtime behaviour of the software with respect to speed, memory
      usage, time measurements, statistical analysis (how often individual components are used)
    - **Build management tools**: Enable versioning, running tests, inspecting code, compiling, creating artifacts and
      other processes when building the code.
    - **Configuration and version management tools**: Supports multiple developers when working on code at different
      places with concepts such as merging, branching etc. (e.g. github)
    - **Code management tools**: Supports developers during the process of creating code with handy functions such as
      code completion, syntax highlighting, organising code, searching for code etc. (e.g. IntelliJ)
    - **Testing tools**: Automate unit, system, integration, end-to-end tests and create reports
    - **Documentation tools**: Supports software architects in the communication of decisions, structures, concepts and
      other information

- **Select tools according to requirements**  
  The work environment and tools depend on the respective conditions, constraints and other influencing factors.
